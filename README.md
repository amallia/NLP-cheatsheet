PDF is automatically generated by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/amallia/NLP-cheatsheet). 
All it needs to be done is create a tag, the job will spin a new linux instance, install the Latex dependencies and compile it into PDF.
The generated file is then attached as a [release](https://github.com/amallia/NLP-cheatsheet/releases)
